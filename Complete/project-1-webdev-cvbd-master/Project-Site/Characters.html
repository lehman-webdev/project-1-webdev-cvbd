            manic and impulsive criminal from Zaun, Jinx lives to wreak havoc without care for the consequences. With an
            arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest explosions to leave a trail of
            mayhem
            and panic in her wake. Jinx despises boredom, and gleefully brings her own chaotic brand of pandemonium
            wherever
            she goes.
            No one knows for sure exactly where Jinx came from, but many urban legends and folktales have sprung up
            around
            her. Some have her as a young gang member who fell in with the wrong crowd and was either traumatized by one
            too
            many killings, suffered too much at the hands of an enemy, or was simply driven insane by sump fumes.

            Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 is arguably the most pivotal and important figure of the human race in
            the
            mid-26th century. Abducted at the age of six years old from his homeworld of Eridanus II by the Office of
            Naval
            Intelligence (ONI), he was conscripted into the SPARTAN-II program. The initiative was originally designed
            to
            quell human rebellion against the Unified Earth Government as the human Insurrection movement neared its
            tipping
            point. John endured harsh physical and mental training, survived the physical augmentations required by the
            program, and was integrated into state-of-the-art Mjolnir battle armor. He was later paired with an
            incredibly
            advanced Smart AI known as Cortana. John and Cortana were the culminations of the SPARTAN-II and MJOLNIR
            programs, allowing a Spartan to safely carry an extremely powerful AI into combat--an advancement that
            ultimately changed the course of the war.

            Throughout his training and early career, John emerged as a clear leader among the Spartans and was set to
            lead
            a successful UNSC campaign to stop a brewing human civil war. In reality, he became the salvation of the
            human
            race itself not once, but twice. First, in the face of an alien hegemony called the Covenant--an alien
            empire
            bent on the complete destruction of humanity in order to assure their ascendance into misguided godhood.
            Most
            recently, John defended humanity against the efforts of an ancient Forerunner called the Didact, who
            returned to
            exact his revenge against humanity for wars fought a hundred millennia before.

            Sergeant Marcus Michael Fenix ES is a former Gear soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments army. A
            legendary war hero, Marcus served with distinction in the Pendulum Wars, which earned him the Embry Star,
            the
            COG's highest military award, for his actions during the Battle of Aspho Fields. He is also a convicted
            "coward"
            for his actions at the Battle of Ephyra. Like the rest of humankind, he saw everything change on Emergence
            Day.
            Marcus bravely fought against the Locust for ten years until the Battle of Ephyra, where he abandoned his
            post
            to rescue his father, Professor Adam Fenix, but could not reach him in time. With his father presumed dead,
            Marcus was tried for dereliction of duty and sentenced to 40 years in Jacinto Maximum Security Prison. He
            was
            incarcerated for four years before being released by his longtime friend, Dominic Santiago. Marcus was later
            promoted to replace Lt. Minh Young Kim after the squad leader's death. Along with the rest of Delta Squad,
            he
            successfully detonated the Lightmass Bomb and destroyed much of the Locust Hollow. With his reputation
            restored,
            Marcus continued fighting against the Locust, culminating in the Sinking of Jacinto

    <div id="myDIV5">
        <p id="milesText"> Miles Morales, a young kid from Brooklyn visited his uncle Aaron Davis (which was against his
            parents' wishes, due to his uncle's criminal past) after being awarded the final spot in a charter school
            lottery. At his uncle's apartment Miles was bitten by the Oz-enhanced spider, which emerged from Aaron's
            bag, and Miles discovered he received super-human abilities like camouflage, increased agility, as well as
            some sort of stun blast, and upon revealing his newly found powers to his best friend, Ganke Lee, both
            concluded he had power similar to Spider-Man's, including wall-crawling.[18][19] But Miles reacted
            negatively, as he just wanted to be normal, and decided to leave heroism to the actual Spider-Man.

            Months later, Spider-Man died saving his family from Osborn. Miles arrived late to the scene. Struck with
            grief at not helping Peter Parker before his demise, Miles decided to follow Parker's philosophy -- with
            great power comes great responsibility -- and so continue Peter's legacy.</p>
