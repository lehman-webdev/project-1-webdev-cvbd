        Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 is arguably the most pivotal and important figure of the human race in the mid-26th century. Abducted at the age of six years old from his homeworld of Eridanus II by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), he was conscripted into the SPARTAN-II program. The initiative was originally designed to quell human rebellion against the Unified Earth Government as the human Insurrection movement neared its tipping point. John endured harsh physical and mental training, survived the physical augmentations required by the program, and was integrated into state-of-the-art Mjolnir battle armor. He was later paired with an incredibly advanced Smart AI known as Cortana. John and Cortana were the culminations of the SPARTAN-II and MJOLNIR programs, allowing a Spartan to safely carry an extremely powerful AI into combat--an advancement that ultimately changed the course of the war.

        Throughout his training and early career, John emerged as a clear leader among the Spartans and was set to lead a successful UNSC campaign to stop a brewing human civil war. In reality, he became the salvation of the human race itself not once, but twice. First, in the face of an alien hegemony called the Covenant--an alien empire bent on the complete destruction of humanity in order to assure their ascendance into misguided godhood. Most recently, John defended humanity against the efforts of an ancient Forerunner called the Didact, who returned to exact his revenge against humanity for wars fought a hundred millennia before.
