    <div id="myDIV2">
        Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 is arguably the most pivotal and important figure of the human race in the
        mid-26th century. Abducted at the age of six years old from his homeworld of Eridanus II by the Office of Naval
        Intelligence (ONI), he was conscripted into the SPARTAN-II program. The initiative was originally designed to
        quell human rebellion against the Unified Earth Government as the human Insurrection movement neared its tipping
        point. John endured harsh physical and mental training, survived the physical augmentations required by the
        program, and was integrated into state-of-the-art Mjolnir battle armor. He was later paired with an incredibly
        advanced Smart AI known as Cortana. John and Cortana were the culminations of the SPARTAN-II and MJOLNIR
        programs, allowing a Spartan to safely carry an extremely powerful AI into combat--an advancement that
        ultimately changed the course of the war.

        Throughout his training and early career, John emerged as a clear leader among the Spartans and was set to lead
        a successful UNSC campaign to stop a brewing human civil war. In reality, he became the salvation of the human
        race itself not once, but twice. First, in the face of an alien hegemony called the Covenant--an alien empire
        bent on the complete destruction of humanity in order to assure their ascendance into misguided godhood. Most
        recently, John defended humanity against the efforts of an ancient Forerunner called the Didact, who returned to
        exact his revenge against humanity for wars fought a hundred millennia before.

        <p id="milesText"> Miles Morales, a young kid from Brooklyn visited his uncle Aaron Davis (which was against his parents' wishes, due to his uncle's criminal past) after being awarded the final spot in a charter school lottery. At his uncle's apartment Miles was bitten by the Oz-enhanced spider, which emerged from Aaron's bag, and Miles discovered he received super-human abilities like camouflage, increased agility, as well as some sort of stun blast, and upon revealing his newly found powers to his best friend, Ganke Lee, both concluded he had power similar to Spider-Man's, including wall-crawling.[18][19] But Miles reacted negatively, as he just wanted to be normal, and decided to leave heroism to the actual Spider-Man.

        Months later, Spider-Man died saving his family from Osborn. Miles arrived late to the scene. Struck with grief at not helping Peter Parker before his demise, Miles decided to follow Parker's philosophy -- with great power comes great responsibility -- and so continue Peter's legacy.</p>
